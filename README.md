# Colorful Theme for webЯcacade

Inspired by the [Colorful theme for BigBox](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/2081-colorful-bigbox-theme/),
this theme makes your webЯcacade feed shine, with colorful images, and subtle
animations.

To use this theme, you can use the included system backgrounds and thumbnails in
your feed, and include the CSS in your feed properties:

```
"props": {
    "css": [
      "http://address-to-your/style.css"
    ]
  }
```

Note that at present, CSS themes are only available through the [staging site](http://play-staging.webrcade.com/).
